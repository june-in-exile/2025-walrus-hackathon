      summary: Create a new earn-out deal
      description: |
        **Purpose**: Create a new M&A earn-out deal on the Sui blockchain

        **Business Logic**:
        - Creates on-chain Deal object via Move contract
        - Stores metadata in local database for faster queries
        - Initializes empty periods array (periods added via parameters endpoint)
        - Returns unsigned transaction for user to sign with wallet

        **Sui Integration**:
        - Writes: Creates new Deal object via `earnout::create_deal()`
        - Transaction: Returns unsigned transaction for frontend to sign
        - Events: Emits `DealCreated` event on-chain with dealId
        - Gas: Estimated ~1,000,000 MIST

        **Seal Integration**:
        - Creates corresponding Seal policy for this deal
        - Initializes access control: buyer can read/write, seller/auditor can read

        **Access Control**:
        - Role: Buyer/Acquirer Admin only
        - Verification: Checks that userAddress will be set as buyer

    get:
      summary: Get comprehensive dashboard data for a deal
      description: |
        **Purpose**: Provide one-stop overview of deal status, progress, and health metrics

        **Business Logic**:
        - Aggregates data from multiple sources (Sui blockchain, Walrus metadata, local cache)
        - Shows period-by-period progress summary
        - Lists recent events and activities
        - Calculates health metrics and identifies risks
        - Suggests next actions based on user role and current status

        **Dashboard Components**:

        1. **Deal Info**: Basic deal details and user's role
        2. **Periods Summary**: Status of each earn-out period
           - Data upload progress (blob count, completeness)
           - KPI status (not proposed / proposed / approved / rejected)
           - Settlement status (not settled / pending / settled)
           - Payout amounts
        3. **Recent Events**: Timeline of important actions
           - Data uploads
           - KPI proposals and attestations
           - Settlements
           - Role updates
        4. **Health Metrics**: Overall deal health
           - Progress percentage
           - Pending actions requiring attention
           - Next deadlines
           - Risk detection (missing data, delays, etc.)

        **Sui Integration**:
        - Reads: Deal object, all Period objects
        - Events: Recent blockchain events (last 50 events)
        - Aggregation: Combines on-chain state with cached metadata
        - Caching: Dashboard data cached for 30 seconds

        **Walrus Integration**:
        - Metadata: Blob counts and last upload timestamps
        - Completeness: Calculates data completeness score per period

        **Role-Specific Views**:
        - **Buyer**: Sees upload progress, pending KPI proposals, settlement opportunities
        - **Seller**: Monitors buyer's data submissions, tracks expected payouts
        - **Auditor**: Sees pending KPI reviews, attestation queue

        **Use Cases**:
        - Landing page after selecting a deal
        - Quick health check without drilling into details
        - Identifying what actions are needed next
        - Monitoring overall earn-out progress

        **Data Source**:
        The system retrieves blob metadata from two sources:
        1. **On-chain data**: Blob IDs registered via `add_walrus_blob` Move function
        2. **Walrus storage**: Download metadata envelope from each blob to get detailed information

        **Response Format**:
        Returns an array of blob metadata objects, each containing:
        - Basic info: blobId, size, uploadedAt, uploaderAddress
        - Classification: dataType (revenue_journal, ebitda_report, etc.), periodId
        - File info: filename, mimeType, description
        - Encryption: encryptionMode (client_encrypted or server_encrypted)
        - Access control: Seal policy information for decryption

        **Performance Considerations**:
        - This endpoint may be slow for deals with many blobs (requires downloading metadata from each)
        - Future optimization: Cache blob metadata in backend database
        - Pagination support included for large datasets

        **Access Control**:
        - Authentication required: User must provide valid Sui signature
        - Authorization: User must be a participant in the deal (buyer/seller/auditor)
        - Only authorized users can see the list of blobs

        **Next Steps After Retrieval**:
        - Frontend can display the list of files with download buttons
        - Users can call `GET /walrus/download/{blobId}?dealId={dealId}` to download specific files
        - Frontend uses `X-Seal-Package-Id` and `X-Seal-Whitelist-Id` from download response to decrypt
